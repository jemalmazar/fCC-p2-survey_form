# freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Project 2 - Build a Survey Form

View deployed web page at: https://jemalmazar.github.io/fCC-p2-survey_form/

**Project Description**

An Animal Crossing inspired single page form with various input types. Users are asked to give feedback on their stay at the campsite.

**Tools & Methods Used**

The following were used to build this page:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- CSS Flexbox
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) (browser-sync, gulp-clean-css, gulp-rename)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

**Little Things I Learned**

- offset an input's label using `position: relative` in conjunction with direction properties
- styling an input's placeholder text using the `::placeholder` pseudo-element

**Project Epilogue**

I chose to build this web form with an Animal Crossing theme after purchasing New Horizons to help pass the time during the COVID-19 lockdown. It ate up a little too much time :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

A simple and straightforward project with a few challenging details. Offsetting input labels turned out to be fairly simple with `position: relative` and the direction properties. Originally tried to style custom radio buttons and checkboxes, but I couldn't make it work and decided it wasn't worth the hassle. It's something I'd like to revisit in the future.

Overall, the project helped reinforce HTML and CSS principles while focusing on web forms.
