# freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Project 2 - Build a Survey Form

View deployed web page at: https://jemalmazar.github.io/fCC-p2-survey_form/

**Project Description**

An Animal Crossing inspired single page form with various input types. Users are asked to give feedback on their stay at the campsite.

**Tools & Methods Used**

The following were used to build this page:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Figma

**Little Things I Learned**

- offset an input's label using _position: relative_ in conjunction with direction properties
- styling an input's placeholder text using the _::placeholder_ pseudo-element

**Project Epilogue**

A simple and straightforward project with a few challenging details. Offsetting input labels turned out to be fairly simple with _position: relative_ and the direction properties. Originally tried to style custom radio buttons and checkboxes, but I couldn't make it work and decided it wasn't worth the hassle. It's something I'd like to revisit in the future.
